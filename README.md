TeXcount
========

A [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) package to provide access to [TeXcount](http://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/) from a simple keyboard shortcut: `cmd+l, w` on OS X, and `ctrl+l, w` on Linux (be careful `ctrl+w` is close tab).

Installation
------------

Checkout to Sublime Text 2 Packages folder.

Or with Package Control:

1. Call Package Control: Add Repository then paste `https://github.com/bensowden/TeXcount` in to the field
2. Call Package Control: Install Package and select TeXcount from the list.

This way will ensure it remains up to date (by using Package Control: Upgrade Package)
